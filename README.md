# Description

Most dialogue models developed up to now have approached dialogue modelling as a sequence-to-sequence task and these models might suffer from factual errors, repetition and generic responses. On the other hand, humans rely on their existing relevant background knowledge when having a conversation with each other in natural settings, in addition to paying attention to certain cues. Incorporating external knowledge and side knowledge from similar data, along with attention into dialogue modelling would help overcome the problems that are commonly observed in sequence-to-sequence models. This, in turn, would make the responses of chatbots more human-like, which would result in a more realistic and positive user experience. Our results indicated that including movie embeddings to make use of similar dialogs helps the model to generate more human-like responses.
